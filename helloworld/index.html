# This is the list of files which are allowed for the webserver to access.
# Note that this is mostly a CSV file, with TAB as delimiters.
# Each line should have at least three columns.
#
# Column 1: Mimetype. Sorry, this is the hardest part to figure out the 
# correct ones. But you will manage.
# Column 2: The actual filename. Including the path, relative to the runpath.
# Column 3: The requested file, as it comes from the the client.
# Column 4...n are aliases for this request.
#
# Note that the columns start with a /
# Also note that there is only ONE TAB ALLOWED AT THE MOMENT. (Sorry)

# No, there are no other error codes.
